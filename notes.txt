What is a Queue?
  It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.


Queue Rule
  Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.


In Queue and De-Queue
  When you get in the line this is called In Queue, and when you remove some body in the it's called De-Queue


Queue with Array
  In Queue we add from one end and remove from other end, it doesn't matter which end. In array shift() takes O(n) time, and pop() takes O(1).


Queue with Linked List
  In Linked List adding at the end takes O(1), and removing a item from the start takes O(1) also. In Linked List don't De-Queue from the tail end.


In Queus we use First and Last instead of Head and Tail.
